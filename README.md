# Prework Study Guide!

## Description

I made this page as a fun, class relevant way to take notes. While I have a beginners knowledge with back-end coding from my bachelor's in video game design, I was lacking in front end coding and version control with git. This page helps me keep track of everything I'm learning.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section has notes corresponding to the section title, some were given during the course, others I added as I went so I could reference them while working on the page. Specifically, I needed to rehash git A TON, so I added notes on the different git commands I learned and my own description between () after the command. This helped out a ton, and saved me from some VERY SCARY branch switches! The HTML and CSS work I did is obviously visible on the page as-is, but the javascript work is visible in the web console. Hit refresh to see the subject at the bottom change every so often!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

No features yet, but I may add some later to practice interactivity with web apps.
